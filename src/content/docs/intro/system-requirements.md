Since DnD Forms is a web application the only requirement is the use of a web browser that is kept updated. It is recomended to use Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge since these browsers have access to the file system on a computer.
Your internet browser must be this version or above:

| Browser | Version |
| ------- | ------: |
| Chrome  | 87+     |
| Edge    | 88+     |
| Firefox | 78+     |
| Safari  | 13+     |

You can check your browser version on the About page usually you can find it on the settings option.
If the browser you are using is not listed or is below the recomended version you may experience problems using this application.
